`ERC20` defines some basic interfaces for token interactions but users don't have a way to react to an approval or a token 
transfer natively. The only solution is to listen to certain events offchain and react to them. In the meantime, token sender,
receiver, and operator cannot communicate at all.
To address these issues, `ERC777` and `ERC1363` are introduced.`ERC777` introduces `tokensToSend` and `tokensToReceive` hooks
and `data` & `operatorData` fields in many functions. This allows users/smart contracts to be able to perform certain actions
upon token transfer and receive. `ERC1363` introduces `onTransferReceived` and `onApprovalReceived` hooks and new versions of 
transfer and approve functions (e.g. `transferAndCall`, `approveAndCall`) which will call the above hooks on the receivers.

Specific to `ERC1363`, quote from its EIP: 
```
There is no way to execute code after a ERC-20 transfer or approval (i.e. making a payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay GAS twice.

This proposal wants to make token payments easier and working without the use of any other listener. It allows to make a callback after a transfer or approval in a single transaction.
```



`ERC777` is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. Its `tokensToSend` hook will be executed before balance is updated and tokens
are transferred. This violates the Check-Effect-Interaction pattern. A successful attach can be performed
like [this](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/exploiting-uniswap-from-reentrancy-to-actual-profit).
Basically, in an LP, a malicious contract wants to trade this `ERC777` token for another token (B). After receiving B token
and before sending `ERC777` tokens, the `tokensToSend` hook is called. This malicious contract's hook can re-enter the swap
function and trade more `ERC777` tokens for B token. Although B token's balance in this LP is correct, but this `ERC777` token's
balance is still less than what it should be because the transfer of the first transaction is not yet finished. So this malicious
contract will get a discount in this second transaction caused by reentrancy.
