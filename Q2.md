According to `ERC20` both `transfer` and `transferFrom` return a boolean and may or may not revert when failure occurs.
In order to understand if the function succeeds, the caller always needs to check return values and decode them to boolean.
`SafeERC20` provides a uniform interface to interact with different tokens. It will revert when a function returns false.
This is much more convenient and less error-prone.

In order to prevent double-spending allowance, some token contracts may require setting allowance to zero before setting
it to a new non-zero value. `SafeERC20` provides functions like `safeApprove` and `forceApprove` to update allowance properly.
These functions work with tokens both with and without double-spending protections. `SafeERC20` also provides functions
to safely increase and decrease allowance as convenience functions.

Generally, `SafeERC20` should be used when interacting with non-standard `'ERC20'` tokens, especially when calling functions
on an address which is supposed to be `ERC20` token address.
